## input 
tell me why yellow can be considered an evil color.

## Response 

Yellow usually carries positive connotations—warmth, sunlight, vitality—but across cultures and in symbolic traditions, it also has darker, “evil” associations. Here are some of the main reasons yellow has historically been considered an evil or unsettling color:

---

### 1. **Decay and Disease**

* Yellow evokes bile, pus, and sickness. In humoral medicine, “yellow bile” was associated with anger and imbalance.
* Jaundice turns the skin yellow, linking the color to weakness, corruption, and death.
* In the Middle Ages, yellow was sometimes used to mark out the diseased (like lepers or plague victims).

### 2. **Treachery and Deceit**

* Judas Iscariot, the betrayer of Christ, is often depicted in yellow robes in medieval and Renaissance art.
* Because of this, yellow became associated with betrayal, cowardice, and falsehood in European tradition.
* Yellow clothing was sometimes forced on marginalized groups (like Jews in medieval Europe), branding them as outsiders or “traitors” to the social order.

### 3. **Madness and Corruption**

* In literature, yellow often represents psychological disturbance—Charlotte Perkins Gilman’s *The Yellow Wallpaper* uses it to signify illness and madness.
* Bright, acidic yellows can feel nauseating or destabilizing—more manic than joyful, unsettling rather than comforting.

### 4. **Poison and Danger**

* Many poisonous plants, insects, and animals use yellow as a warning color (wasps, vipers, toxic frogs). This biological association bleeds into symbolic systems: yellow becomes a color of danger and aggression.
* Alchemy sometimes associated yellow with sulfur (“brimstone”), a fiery and hellish substance.

### 5. **Ambiguity and Corruption of Light**

* Yellow sits between the pure white of light and the fiery red of passion. Symbolically, it can feel like a corrupted sunlight—once golden, now faded, tarnished, or rotten.
* Gold (positive yellow) represents divine radiance, but when degraded, yellow turns into something false: fool’s gold, greed, and decadence.
